# Requirements

![actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barrosfilipe/install-vsc-hk416-theme/main/screenshots/hk416.gif)

> Use the **Fix VSCode Checkums** extension to remove the `[Unsupported]` tag

> Enable the **HK416** theme

# Important

**It does change VSCode `electron-browser` internals** which leads to an `[Unsupported]` installation.

> Tested on version `1.63.2` *use at your own risk.*

> `electron-browser` modified files are [here](https://github.com/barrosfilipe/install-vsc-hk416-theme/tree/main/workbench)

```
Note: You can change the [wallpaper.png] to your favorite one.
